# The Island of Shaders
Project to learn and test Godot Engine 3.x Shaders (discontinued, look at [MTH](https://github.com/w84death/mystic-treasure-hunt))

## Game based on this tech
I'm continuing this project as a real game [Mystic Treasure Hunt](https://github.com/w84death/mystic-treasure-hunt). I'm recommending to look at the new code as it was refactored and polished.

## Open Source Engine
Game is made using **Godot Engine 3.1-dev**. To run the project form source code you'll need the [latest Godot Engine build](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/). It will not work on 2.1 nor 3.0.


## Technology
Custom made shaders for:
- terrain (heightmap, 4 textures)
- grass
- water, [blog post about water shader](http://krzysztofjankowski.com/blog/water-shader-in-godotengine-3.html).
- butterfly's
